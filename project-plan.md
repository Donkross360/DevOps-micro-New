# DevOps Project Implementation Plan

## 1. Project Overview
- Brief description of the project goals and objectives.
- Key stakeholders and team members.

## 2. Architecture Design

### Current Services
- **Frontends**:
  - `frontend-react`: React SPA with:
    - JWT auth flow
    - Protected routes
    - API service integration
  - `frontend-html`: Lightweight implementation:
    - Vanilla JS auth
    - Nginx serving

- **Backend Services**:
  - `auth`: JWT authentication service
    - Login/validate endpoints
    - Secure token handling
  - `backend`: Core API service
    - Protected endpoints
    - Database integration
  - `db`: PostgreSQL database
    - Health checks
    - Persistent storage

- **Future Services**:
  - `user`: User management (in development)
  - `payment`: Payment processing (planned)
- Security considerations for each service, including JWT-based authentication flow:
  - Frontend communicates with the `auth` service for login and registration.
  - `auth` service issues JWTs for authenticated sessions.
  - Frontend includes JWT in requests to the backend for authorization.
  - Backend verifies JWTs to ensure secure access to resources.

## 3. Development Environment Setup

### Current Implementation
- Docker Compose with:
  - Frontend selection via profiles:
    - `--profile react`: React frontend (default)
    - `--profile html`: HTML frontend (nginx)
  - Health checks for all services
  - Proper service dependencies
  - Network isolation
- Security features:
  - JWT authentication with secret rotation
  - Rate limiting (100 requests/15min)
  - Input validation
  - CORS restrictions
  - Helmet security headers

### Developer Quickstart
```bash
# 1. Copy and setup environment
cp .env.example .env
make secrets

# 2. Start services (React frontend)
docker-compose --profile react up -d

# 3. Verify
curl -I http://localhost:3000
```

### Verification Checklist
- [x] All services start healthy
- [x] Frontends accessible:
  - React: http://localhost:3000
  - HTML: http://localhost:8080
- [x] Auth endpoints functional
- [x] Protected routes enforce JWT
- [x] Database connection working

## 4. Production Environment Setup
- Kubernetes configuration for production deployment.
- Security measures for production (e.g., secret management, access controls).

## 5. Monitoring and Logging
- Setup Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, and Fluent Bit for both environments.
- Configure Alertmanager for alert routing.
- Define and track DORA metrics.

## 6. CI/CD Pipeline
- Design and implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.
- Automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

## 7. Testing Strategy
- Define a testing strategy that includes unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests.
- Ensure that tests are automated and integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

## 8. Backup and Disaster Recovery
- Plan for data backup and recovery processes.
- Implement disaster recovery strategies to ensure business continuity.

## 9. Scalability and Performance
- Consider how the system will scale with increased load.
- Perform load testing to identify potential bottlenecks.

## 10. Compliance and Security Audits
- Ensure that the system complies with relevant regulations and standards.
- Plan for regular security audits and vulnerability assessments.

## 11. Documentation and Training

### User Documentation
- [Setup Guide](doc/setup-guide.md) - Getting started instructions
- API Reference (coming soon)
- Troubleshooting Guide (coming soon)

### Admin Documentation
- [Production Deployment Guide](doc/production.md) (coming soon)
- Monitoring Setup
- Backup Procedures

### Training Materials
- Developer Onboarding Checklist
- API Usage Examples
- Security Best Practices

## 12. Progress Tracking and Updates
- Regularly update the document with completed tasks and any changes.
- Include a section for notes and feedback.

## 13. Review and Feedback
- Schedule regular reviews to assess progress and gather feedback.
- Adjust the plan as necessary based on team input and project needs.

## 14. Detailed Task Breakdown
- Break down each section into smaller, actionable tasks.
- Assign responsibilities and deadlines for each task.

## 15. Dependencies and Prerequisites
- Identify dependencies and prerequisites for each task.
- Ensure tasks are completed in the correct order.

## 16. Milestones and Deadlines
- Set clear milestones and deadlines for each major phase.
- Track progress against these milestones.

## 17. Risk Management
- Identify potential risks and mitigation strategies.
- Prepare for possible challenges and how to address them.

## 18. Resource Allocation
- Specify resources required for each task (e.g., tools, personnel).
- Ensure the team is adequately equipped to complete tasks.

## 19. Feedback Loop
- Establish a process for regular feedback and iteration.
- Ensure continuous improvement and alignment with project goals.
